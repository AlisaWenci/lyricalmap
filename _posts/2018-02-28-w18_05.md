#### Frank O. Gehry and Associates Inc.

Frank O. Gehry was born in New York City, raised in Ontario and Toronto, and eventually settling in California. His passion for architecture originated from the times he spent as a stock-boy at his grandfather’s hardware store. Playing with his grandmother, he would often use the shavings and disposed-of parts to create futuristic cityscapes. At age 17, Gehry’s family relocated to Los Angeles. During his time studying architecture at the University of Southern California (USC), he spent most weekends independently studying the Case Study Houses of Richard Neutra and Charles Eames. Admiring the simple and affordable nature behind such designs, Gehry harnessed his inspirations to base his senior thesis on an affordable housing project. Neutra’s own apprentice, Gregory Ain, happened to be a professor at USC and took a liking to Gehry. Under the guidance of Ain, Gehry graduated top of his class, deciding to pursue a city planning program at Harvard University. There, Gehry stumbled upon a class on Le Corbusier, who would become one of his great influencers. Through Le Corbusier, a cubist painter turned designer and radical architect, Gehry bridged the connection between art and architecture, paving the way for the engineering of his own signature style. 

In a letter to Elaine Jones, the wife of world-renowned architect A. Quincy Jones, Frank O. Gehry’s solemn, reflective voice pays homage to the man whom he considered an inspiration. Dated to 1979, the letter consists of Gehry reflecting on the time he spent studying architecture under Jones as an undergraduate at the University of Southern California. Gehry speaks of a “model of what an architecture was” - an image of determination that remained with Gehry in his pursuit of discovering and building his own brand. Concluding the letter, Gehry reminds Jones’ widow that he is there for her in any time of need, just as her late husband was always there for him.

Frank O. Gehry and Associates, Inc., better known as FOGA, formed in 1962 when Gehry returned to Los Angeles after working for a few years at an architecture firm in Paris. FOGA’s beginning was modest, but after taking on many smaller projects, the name quickly spread. The company’s main breakthrough was the design of the Kay Jewelers office and warehouse. The striking Japanese-inspired project is, as described by Laurence Chollet, the milestone of Gehry “finding his voice.” The Kay Jewelers project filled the public as well as other architects with awe because of its noticeable deviation in style from the surrounding buildings and its use of low cost, American-made materials. Gehry challenged traditional architecture with his bold and colorful designs, as well as use of humble materials, ideas he gathered from his many friendships with modern artists. Mimicking Los Angeles based artists like Ed Keinholz and Ed Ruscha, Gehry aimed to incorporate recycled materials and create something valuable from something cheap. 

Over the next decade, Gehry’s company as well as his family grew. After the birth of Gehry’s first child, his family decided it was time to move. In 1977, Gehry’s second wife encouraged him to use their new house as his own personal project, and the infamous Gehry Residence was built. The building was designed for pure function and made from cheap materials. The radical half-open half-closed concept pushed several neighbors to sue the Gehry family for leaving their house “unfinished.” Soon after the success of the Gehry Residence, FOGA staff was reduced from forty employees to only three. By this time, Gehry and his company could deny any project that did not suit Gehry’s artistic endeavours. In the following years, Gehry transformed Los Angeles; FOGA designed and constructed many large scale projects such as The Familian House in Santa Monica, the Norton House in Venice, the California Aerospace Museum, the Frances Goldwyn Hollywood Regional Branch Library, and Loyola University’s Law School. Gehry’s work is so well known that an unconventional art-style of architecture emerged, emulating Gehry’s repurposing of materials to create beautiful designs. As the movement grew, it became known as “LA Style.”

The Walt Disney Concert Hall undoubtedly stands tall in Downtown Los Angeles as one the city’s premier cultural icons. Frank O. Gehry’s contributions to creating landmark structures throughout the world may have cemented his status as an architectural titan; however, sitting right at the heart of Gehry’s home city, this project holds distinct value as both a civic amenity and personal accomplishment. This labor of love was not born without struggle. The initial donation of $50 million by Lillian Disney in 1987 proved to be insufficient as, by the 90s, projected costs rose to $265 million. This led to the project shutting down in 1994, only to be revived two years later courtesy of mass fundraisers and donations. 

Gehry, at this point protesting the obscure references of post-modernist architects, drew inspiration from the Paleozoic era: the free-flowing natural curves of water assimilated into a multitude of his deconstructivist works, with the Walt Disney Concert Hall prominently showcasing his signature methodology. The sleek stainless steel exterior, almost a thaumaturgy in its own right, stands at radical obtuse angles- appearing on the border of collapse, yet taut and in perfect, if tenuous, balance. This choice not only symbolizes fluid musical movement, but also the constant motion of the city of Los Angeles itself. The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation Atrium Hall features aesthetic columns clothed in Douglas fir, which serve functional purposes as well. Distinct floral patterns and flowering motifs in the public garden area, complemented by the tree trunks, exemplify how well the structure converses with nature. Gehry’s “A Rose for Lilly,” a beautifully constructed fountain, pays homage to the initial donor; Lillian Disney’s wishes largely impacted the construction of this architectural marvel. The Garden’s 45 trees, which speak for six distinct varieties from orchid trees to pink trumpet trees, are all indigenous to Los Angeles. The bejeweled Auditorium, with all its rich woods and billowing curves, invites warmth and intimacy; in Gehry’s words, it stands as a motif for a wooden boat that takes the audience and the orchestra on a musical journey. The visitors surround the stage, an oddity that engages the musicians with the listeners in conversation. Gehry’s vision for this space, finally materializing in 2003, clearly transcended traditional markers for acoustic halls, becoming one of the select characteristic figures in Los Angeles.

Today, Frank Gehry resides in Los Angeles and continues to design some of the most famous buildings in the US and abroad. He was recently employed by the city of LA to take over the redevelopment program for the LA River. As is typical, Gehry has stressed that he will be taking a data-driven and scientific approach, which can in some ways make artistic design difficult. City planning, once an aspiration of Gehry’s, does not allow for creativity in quite the same way that he is used to. In 2016, Gehry was quoted as saying, “Our goal on the housing is, wherever we end up, our value system says we want to get it so that it's mixed, so it's not just low-end housing and middle-end and high-end — we want to collide them somehow.” A 2017 Gehry, having met with the board of the LA River project, mostly investors and property owners, seemed less excited. “You can’t build habitat and you can’t build space for recreation in the river, I can tell you it will never happen.” Gehry stressed that were the river to be opened up for recreation, it would need to be made at least seven times wider to accommodate flood drainage. Maybe this is true, or perhaps Gehry, notorious for his socialist sensibilities, is diplomatically announcing his withdrawal from the project. In any case, with a legacy of such pioneering in the fields of construction and urban design it is hard to cast aspersions.
