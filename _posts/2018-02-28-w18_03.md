These two images from the Los Angeles Daily News demonstrate the visible effects of Los Angeles air pollution in the 1950s. The “Smog Dog” photograph shows a barely conscious dog lying on its side with a gas mask strapped onto its snout. The positioning of the dog in the center of the photograph, coupled with the sepia tone, conveys the physical and emotional suffering brought about by air pollution. The photographer's capturing of such a gut-wrenching scene encourages citizens to combat the harmful environmental conditions and restore the natural beauty of the city. The other photograph displays the physical effects of air pollution in Los Angeles, showing the City Hall building in a visible layer of smog. The Los Angeles Daily News published these photographs in 1954, during the city’s worst recorded air pollution crisis. Just one year later in 1955, downtown Los Angeles experienced the most harmful stretch of ozone pollution recorded in United States history. Average amounts of smog were six times the maximum allowable rate under current federal standards (Barringer). Air quality in the city endangered the lives of its citizens who suffered from lung disease and eye irritation. Around 1950, the government estimated that 1,300 people died from air pollution alone in the city of Los Angeles (Lloyd et al.). Together these two photographs jointly demonstrate the physical and emotional hardships that air pollution brought to the city. 

As one of the largest industrial cities in the United States, Los Angeles experienced exponential population and economic growth post-World War II. The mid-twentieth century Los Angeles air pollution crisis resulted from the sudden population growth and the emergence of the automobile industry: the city’s population reached nearly five and a half million in 1950 from one million in 1920, and its automobile count exceeded two million (Gonzalez 217). Increases in both the number and users of automobiles led to a larger amount of air pollution in the city. Automobiles lacked environmentally friendly models as the government did not regulate fossil fuel emissions. The city’s economic growth also brought air polluting industries such as petroleum production and steel manufacturing, whose factories decreased air quality dramatically.

Los Angeles initially did not understand the link between smog and automobiles. People believed that the rapid increase in wartime factory production caused the increase in smog independently of other factors. The local government also did not know whether smog actually posed any health issues as smog-related diseases did not exist in public record at the time (UCLA). Only after various public protests demanding action did the government provide funds to research the cause of the city’s smog. Arie Jan Haagen-Smit, Professor of Bio-organic Chemistry at Caltech, discovered that the large amount of air pollution resulted from the release of two types of material: hydrocarbons from gasoline, and a mixture of nitrogen oxides (Haagen-Smit). In the presence of sunlight, a reaction occurs between these two materials which leads to aerosol formation and the release of ozone and various oxidation products. 

After the county of Los Angeles realized its air pollution problem, it measured the pollution levels of the air in order to find a solution. By 1960, the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District had maintained a Total Air Pollution Survey for eight years, which took comprehensive statistics by looking at sources of air contaminants emitted into the atmosphere, including gasoline/diesel-powered vehicles, combustion of fuels, evaporation of organic liquids, petroleum refining and emissions of aerosols (Chass et al. 351-364). The statistics revealed that the transportation sector, especially automobiles, contributed the most to the three prominent sources of pollution — organic gases, inorganic gases and aerosols (Chass et al. 366). The government, having realized that automobiles produced a large amount of the smog in Los Angeles, responded by forming California’s Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board to monitor the harmful automobile emissions and protect the public from air pollution.

Los Angeles continued to combat air pollution throughout the 1950s and 60s, but the levels of smog did not significantly decrease until Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act. This act gave California the freedom to regulate its pollutant emissions independently, allowing the state to force automobile manufacturers to remove lead from gasoline and install catalytic converters into cars (Barringer). The government also put political pressure on automobile manufacturers, encouraging their engineers to develop practical solutions and monitoring their progress through strict deadlines. By 1980, emission of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide dropped by over sixty six percent, despite Southern California's population increasing by sixty percent and cars tracing twice as many miles (Barringer). Today, Los Angeles’ air pollution levels remain a political topic of conversation, but show a large improvement since the mid-twentieth century with the government having more information about environmental conservation than in the past. Through the use of powerful renewable energy sources and several other political and social methods, Los Angeles has begun to recover from the harmful air conditions that the Los Angeles Daily News captured in these photos.
