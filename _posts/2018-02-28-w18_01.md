The newspaper clippings from _italics_ The Los Angeles Times _italics_ below document the Hillside Strangler case, one of the most serious serial rape and murder accounts in history, as well as comments on the consequences of rape (Liddick). From October 1977 to February 1978, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono raped and strangled ten women, two of whom they followed and abducted from the Eagle Rock Plaza shopping mall (Rogers). The accused men left the various womenâ€™s bodies in the Los Angeles hills: Hollywood Hills, Eagle Rock, Glendale, Echo Park, Highland Park, Burbank, and La Crescenta (Rogers). The mental and emotional disturbances of Bianchi and Buono, along with the media coverage of this case, incited fear within the hillside communities and spurred greater discussion on sexual assault.
