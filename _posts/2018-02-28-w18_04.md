The late 80s and 90s was a tumultuous period of uneven economic development. Exacerbated by existing racial inequalities, racial minorities were often on the short end of the stick as they were affected by the many controversial policies put in place, such as government spending cuts on welfare and relief services. What resulted was an increase in poverty, especially in Los Angeles, where minorities were disproportionately affected by these economic reforms which failed to consider the greater implications on the already-deprived. With little to remedy their pain, it was not uncommon for the poor and disadvantaged to turn to drugs to ease their suffering. 

While racial inequality was an area of concern during the late 1980s, another issue was yet to be addressed - police brutality. Due to bigotry and misperceptions as criminals, minorities were often on the receiving end of such violence, which was exacerbated by the various policies put in place. One such policy would be the Anti-drug Abuse Act passed on October 27, 1986, where a drug sentence over crack cocaine was significantly worse than one for powdered cocaine, despite the two having the same effect on one’s health (Equal Justice Initiative, n.d.). Since crack cocaine was cheaper than powdered ones, Blacks were more affected by the law than Whites, who were relatively more affluent. The act would later lead to an increase of number of Blacks admitted to jail for drugs while there was little change for White citizens (ACLU, 2006). At the same time, this resulted in worsening perceptions of Blacks as drug abusers, which played a factor in police brutality in Los Angeles. With rising concern over the use of violence amongst police forces, police brutality was thus brought to attention in Los Angeles County through various media outlets, such as the LA Youth Newspaper. The LA Youth Newspaper, created after a Supreme Court decision gave school administrators the power to control school newspapers content, was published for 25 years from January 1988 to January of 2013. The newspaper created a press outlet for young people, free of censorship, encouraging teenagers to work on their critical thinking, writing, literacy, and civic education skills and to cover controversial topics. By 2002, LA Youth had become the largest independent teen newspaper in the United States (LA Youth, n.d.). 

In June 1990, an article in the LA Youth Newspaper detailed the tension between Black community members and White police officers. Young civilians were interviewed about the violence they have witnessed from the Los Angeles Police Department. Personal accounts of those interviewed showed how excessive force was used consistently during this time period, and illustrated the various perspectives of the parties involved on police brutality in Los Angeles. The instance that is highlighted in this article was a peaceful protest of police brutality in a Pacific Palisades park. Three men were photographed holding signs that openly ridiculed the police department for their racial discrimination and profiling. Along with this specific act of retaliation, the article also outlined various ways that members of the community could be involved in stopping police misconduct, preparation for talking to the police and knowing one’s rights.

The article thus brought to attention the severity of the police brutality issue in Los Angeles. Racial profiling was especially an area of key concern in Los Angeles, where minorities were unfairly treated, often for crimes they did not commit. The Rodney King Riots, which took place in Los Angeles, 1992, and following the events in the article, demonstrated the need for reform. One can never forget the uproar over this infamous case of police brutality as it shook the entire nation and became a symbol of civil rights and change (CNN, 2012). It is thus important to document these events, significant or insignificant, in remembrance of the scars, the tragedies and the triumphs that shaped Los Angeles today, and the crucial need to uphold civil liberties, indiscriminate of personal identity.
